# Student Dropout Prediction
**Web App: https://student-dropout.streamlit.app/**

**Goal:** 
- Modeling from **scratch** without ML Library
- Data Augmentation using GAN
- Feature Selection using ANOVA
- Visualize insights from data
- Deploy the best model into Web App

**Model from scratch:**
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron
- Support Vector Machine

**Model from ML Library:**
- Catboost Classifier (used in the web app)
