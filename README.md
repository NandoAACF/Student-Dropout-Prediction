# Student Dropout Prediction
**Goal:** 
- Modeling from **scratch** without ML Library
- Data Augmentation using GAN
- Feature Selection using ANOVA
- Deploy Best Model into Web App

**Model from scratch:**
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron
- Support Vector Machine

**Model from ML Library:**
- Catboost Classifier (used in the web app)
